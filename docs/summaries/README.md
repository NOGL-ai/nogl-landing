# Implementation Summaries

This directory contains summaries of completed implementations, bug fixes, and system changes.

## Current Summaries

### General Implementations
- [Implementation Summary](./IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Overview of major implementations
- [Final Fix Summary](./FINAL_FIX_SUMMARY.md) - Summary of final bug fixes
- [Cleanup Summary](./CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md) - Code cleanup and refactoring summary

### Component Implementations
- [Slideout Copilot Complete](./SLIDEOUT_COPILOT_COMPLETE.md) - Slideout widget implementation
- [Toolgroup Implementation Complete](./TOOLGROUP_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) - Tool grouping feature

## Historical Documentation

The [historical](./historical/) subdirectory contains older documentation about cleanup and analysis efforts:
- [Cleanup Analysis Report](./historical/CLEANUP_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md)
- [Cleanup Master Plan](./historical/CLEANUP_MASTER_PLAN.md)
- [Ultimate Analysis](./historical/UltimateAnalysis.md)

## Feature-Specific Summaries

Feature-specific implementation summaries have been moved to [../features/](../features/):
- Copilot features → [features/copilot/](../features/copilot/)
- Assistant UI → [features/assistant-ui/](../features/assistant-ui/)
- Mobile features → [features/mobile/](../features/mobile/)
- And more...

## Purpose

These summaries serve as:
- **Historical record** - What was implemented and why
- **Knowledge base** - Context for future development
- **Onboarding** - Help new developers understand system evolution
- **Decision log** - Track architectural and design decisions

## Writing Implementation Summaries

When completing a major feature or fix, document:

### What Was Done
- Overview of the implementation
- Files changed or created
- Key decisions made

### Why It Was Done
- Problem being solved
- Business/technical requirements
- Alternative approaches considered

### How It Works
- Technical approach
- Architecture changes
- Integration points

### Testing & Verification
- How it was tested
- Verification steps
- Known limitations

### Follow-up Items
- Future improvements
- Technical debt created
- Related work needed

## Archiving Old Summaries

When summaries become outdated or historical:
1. Move to `historical/` subdirectory
2. Update links in other documentation
3. Add context about why it's historical
4. Keep for reference but mark as outdated
