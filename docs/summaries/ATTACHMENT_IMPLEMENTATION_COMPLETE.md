# ✅ Attachment UI Implementation Complete!

## Overview

Successfully added file attachment functionality to the copilot slideout. Users can now attach files to their messages with a beautiful, functional UI.

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Attachment Components Installed

**Command Used:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @assistant-ui/attachment
```

**Created Files:**
- `src/components/attachment.tsx` - Complete attachment UI components
  - `ComposerAttachments` - Shows attachments in the composer
  - `ComposerAddAttachment` - Button to add attachments
  - `UserMessageAttachments` - Shows attachments in user messages
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` - Dialog for attachment preview
- `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` - Tooltips for attachment UI
- `src/components/ui/avatar.tsx` - Avatar for attachment thumbnails
- `src/components/tooltip-icon-button.tsx` - Icon buttons with tooltips

### 2. Custom Thread Component with Attachments

**Command Used:**
```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @assistant-ui/thread
```

**Created Files:**
- `src/components/thread.tsx` - Custom Thread component with attachment support
- `src/components/tool-fallback.tsx` - Fallback UI for tools
- `src/components/markdown-text.tsx` - Markdown rendering

**Key Feature:**
The custom Thread component already includes:
- `<ComposerAttachments />` in composer
- `<ComposerAddAttachment />` button
- `<UserMessageAttachments />` in user messages

### 3. Runtime Attachment Adapter Configured

**File Updated:**
`src/components/application/slideout-menus/copilot-runtime-provider.tsx`

**Added Configuration:**
```typescript
const runtime = useLocalRuntime(N8nAdapter, {
  maxSteps: 5,
  adapters: {
    attachments: {
      accept: "image/*,application/pdf,text/plain,.doc,.docx",
      async upload(file: File) {
        return {
          id: crypto.randomUUID(),
          name: file.name,
          size: file.size,
          type: file.type,
          url: URL.createObjectURL(file),
        };
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Supported File Types:**
- Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, etc.
- Documents: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`

**Current Behavior:**
- Files are stored in memory for UI display
- Creates temporary preview URLs
- No backend upload (files not sent to AI yet)

### 4. Slideout Updated to Use Custom Thread

**File Updated:**
`src/components/application/slideout-menus/copilot-slideout.tsx`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Before
import { Thread } from "@assistant-ui/react-ui";

// After
import { Thread } from "@/components/thread";
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### UI-Only Implementation
- ✅ **Attachment UI works** - Users can attach files
- ✅ **Previews work** - Files display with thumbnails
- ❌ **Files not uploaded** - Files stored in memory only
- ❌ **Files not sent to AI** - n8n doesn't receive attachments
- ❌ **No persistence** - Files lost on page refresh

### What This Means
- Users can attach files and see them in the UI
- Files are **not** sent to the AI backend
- Files are **not** stored permanently
- AI responses will **not** consider the attachments

---

## 🔧 Next Steps (Optional)

To enable full attachment functionality with backend upload:

### 1. Create Upload API Route

Create `src/app/api/ai/upload/route.ts`:

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { getAuthSession } from "@/lib/auth";
import { writeFile } from "fs/promises";
import path from "path";

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  // Authenticate user
  const session = await getAuthSession();
  if (!session?.user?.id) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // Get file from form data
  const formData = await req.formData();
  const file = formData.get("file") as File;

  if (!file) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "No file provided" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Validate file type and size
  const allowedTypes = [
    "image/jpeg", "image/png", "image/gif", "image/webp",
    "application/pdf", "text/plain",
    "application/msword",
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"
  ];

  if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "File type not allowed" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  const maxSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "File too large" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // Save file to uploads directory
  const bytes = await file.arrayBuffer();
  const buffer = Buffer.from(bytes);
  
  const uploadsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), "public", "uploads");
  const filename = `${Date.now()}-${file.name}`;
  const filepath = path.join(uploadsDir, filename);

  await writeFile(filepath, buffer);

  // Return file URL
  return NextResponse.json({
    id: crypto.randomUUID(),
    name: file.name,
    size: file.size,
    type: file.type,
    url: `/uploads/${filename}`,
  });
}
```

### 2. Update Attachment Adapter

Update `copilot-runtime-provider.tsx`:

```typescript
attachments: {
  accept: "image/*,application/pdf,text/plain,.doc,.docx",
  async upload(file: File) {
    // Upload to backend
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append("file", file);

    const response = await fetch("/api/ai/upload", {
      method: "POST",
      body: formData,
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Failed to upload file");
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  },
},
```

### 3. Update Chat API to Send Attachments

Modify `src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` to include attachment data in messages sent to n8n.

### 4. Configure n8n to Handle Attachments

Update n8n workflow to:
- Receive attachment URLs in messages
- Download files if needed
- Process attachments based on type
- Include attachment context in AI prompt
