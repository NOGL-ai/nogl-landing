# Workflow Documentation

This directory contains documentation for various workflows in the application.

## Available Workflows

### ðŸ‘¥ [Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflows](./hitl-workflows.md)
Documentation for approval workflows where AI operations require human review and approval.

**Key Topics:**
- What is HITL and when it's required
- Approval dialog types
- Workflow process (propose â†’ review â†’ approve/reject)
- Best practices for reviewing operations
- Security features and audit trails

**Use Cases:**
- Data modifications (creating, updating, deleting competitors)
- External communications (sending emails, reports)
- Price changes
- Strategic plan execution

## Workflow Categories

### Approval Workflows
Processes that require human review and approval before execution:
- Data modifications
- External communications
- Financial operations
- Strategic decisions

### Automated Workflows
Processes that run automatically based on triggers:
- Data synchronization
- Scheduled reports
- Alert notifications
- Background tasks

### Integration Workflows
Processes that involve external services:
- Payment processing
- Email delivery
- API synchronization
- Webhook handling

## Creating New Workflows

When documenting a new workflow:

1. **Overview**
   - Purpose and goals
   - When to use this workflow
   - Prerequisites

2. **Process Steps**
   - Step-by-step breakdown
   - Decision points
   - Alternative paths

3. **User Roles**
   - Who can initiate
   - Who can approve
   - Required permissions

4. **Technical Details**
   - API endpoints involved
   - Data models
   - Error handling

5. **Best Practices**
   - Common scenarios
   - Troubleshooting
   - Performance considerations

## Workflow Design Principles

1. **Clarity** - Users should understand what will happen at each step
2. **Safety** - Critical operations should have review checkpoints
3. **Efficiency** - Minimize unnecessary steps
4. **Auditability** - Track all actions for compliance
5. **Reversibility** - Provide undo/rollback when possible
