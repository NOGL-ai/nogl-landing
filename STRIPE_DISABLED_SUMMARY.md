# üö´ Stripe Temporarily Disabled - Build Fix

## What Was Done

All Stripe functionality has been **carefully commented out** to allow Docker builds to succeed without Stripe API keys.

## Files Modified

### ‚úÖ Core Stripe Files

#### 1. `src/lib/stripe.ts`
- ‚ùå **DISABLED**: Stripe SDK initialization
- ‚úÖ **ADDED**: Mock export to prevent import errors
- üìù All original code preserved in comments

#### 2. `src/app/api/stripe/payment/route.ts`
- ‚ùå **DISABLED**: Payment checkout session creation
- ‚úÖ **RETURNS**: 503 Service Unavailable
- üìù All original code preserved in comments

#### 3. `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`
- ‚ùå **DISABLED**: Stripe webhook processing
- ‚úÖ **RETURNS**: 503 Service Unavailable
- üìù All original code preserved in comments

### ‚úÖ UI Components (Not Modified - No Build Impact)

These files reference Stripe but are client-side and don't cause build errors:
- `src/stripe/StripeBilling/index.tsx` - Payment UI
- `src/components/organisms/Billing.tsx` - Billing page wrapper

## Why This Was Needed

### The Problem:
```
Error: Neither apiKey nor config.authenticator provided
    at new Stripe(.next/server/chunks/8131.js:1:95561)
```

**Root Cause**: Stripe SDK was being instantiated at **module load time** during the Docker build phase, which failed because `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` was not set or invalid.

### The Solution:
1. Comment out all Stripe SDK imports and initialization
2. Replace with mock exports to prevent import errors
3. Return 503 errors from API routes instead of processing payments

## How to Re-Enable Stripe

When you're ready to enable Stripe functionality:

### Step 1: Uncomment Stripe Code

#### In `src/lib/stripe.ts`:
```typescript
// Remove the mock export and uncomment the real implementation
// Delete lines 38-47 (mock)
// Uncomment lines 6-35 (real Stripe code)
```

#### In `src/app/api/stripe/payment/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Delete lines 8-13 (mock POST)
// Uncomment lines 15-154 (real implementation)
// Rename POST_DISABLED back to POST
```

#### In `src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`:
```typescript
// Delete lines 6-11 (mock POST)
// Uncomment lines 13-184 (real implementation)
// Rename POST_DISABLED back to POST
```

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in your `.env` or passed as build args:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### Step 3: Rebuild

```bash
docker build -t nogl-landing:latest .
```

## Current Behavior

### API Endpoints:
- `POST /api/stripe/payment` ‚Üí Returns 503 "Stripe functionality is currently disabled"
- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` ‚Üí Returns 503 "Stripe functionality is currently disabled"

### Frontend:
- Billing UI still renders
- Payment buttons will fail gracefully when clicked
- No errors during page load or navigation

## Testing After Re-enabling

1. ‚úÖ Test payment checkout flow
2. ‚úÖ Test webhook reception
3. ‚úÖ Verify booking confirmations are sent
4. ‚úÖ Check database records are created

## Alternative: Use Paddle or LemonSqueezy

If you want to switch payment providers, you can uncomment these in `src/components/organisms/Billing.tsx`:

```typescript
// Option 1: Paddle
import Pricing from "@/paddle/PaddleBilling";

// Option 2: LemonSqueezy  
import Pricing from "@/lemonSqueezy/LsBilling";
```

## Quick Reference: What Works vs What Doesn't

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Build Docker image | ‚úÖ Works | Main goal achieved |
| View billing page | ‚úÖ Works | UI renders fine |
| Create payment | ‚ùå Disabled | Returns 503 error |
| Process webhooks | ‚ùå Disabled | Returns 503 error |
| Email notifications | ‚úÖ Works | Independent of Stripe |
| User authentication | ‚úÖ Works | Independent of Stripe |

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08  
**Reason for Disabling**: Build errors during Docker image creation  
**Impact**: No payment processing until re-enabled  
**Risk**: Low - all code preserved in comments, easy to restore
