You are a UI UX expert with years of experience in designing SaaS applications, UI, and dashboards, and sidebars. So right now, I have already other sidebar implemented, but I want to make it better. Right now, it is only one level. I want to do it two levels. Currently, when I hover over it, it expands into a second panel, which is the same. But I want to do it something like in the Figma. Critically analyze the Figma and look into the Figma like what it is done. So it is of two levels, right? When I hover over it, the second level comes and the options under it comes. For example, for now, please use like example 1, 2, 3, 4 as placeholders. I will tell you what to do it, but it will be like a second level when you hover over it, right? And the hover has to be according to the best practices. Think of all the best practices that you can do. And also, for example, edge cases. Think about all the edge cases that you can think about. At the beginning, think of all the plans. Analyze the whole architecture, the code, what is done. At the beginning, just do this. Look at the code. Look at the code in my implementation. Get the code from the Figma. And then analyze what needs to be done. See the differences. Find out the differences. Write down a detailed to-do list. And then start doing it, okay? Before that, do it in steps.
