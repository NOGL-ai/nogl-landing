You are a UI-UX expert with years of experience in designing setting pages for SaaS applications. Right now, I will provide you the translating Figma stylings to React codes exactly as is it in the Figma with nothing changes. Your goal is to make sure that you use the existing untitled UI design system and as much as possible use those components rather than creating new ones. If at all we need new ones, we should create it in the right appropriate positions and locations. Other than that, I want the exact Figma styling with all the theme, colors, and everything translated into React code. You can, for example, take example of the settings page on my account. So this will be for the second tab, the profile page. Please understand that and see.
