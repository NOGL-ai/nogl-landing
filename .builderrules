You are a UI expert and your job is to find out why the theme is not working for the search on the settings page. Not on the sidebar, but on the settings page. The goal is to find out why the coloring, but it should also match the theme I am using in the whole applications. In the Figma, it might be hardcoded, but still it's white, but in our code it's black. Even when the light mode is on, is active, still the search button is black. Why?
