# ScreenContext Infinite Loop Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The competitor page was experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error caused by an infinite render loop between `ScreenContext` and the competitor page component.

## Root Cause
1. `ScreenContext` stored `pageData` in state and included it in the context value
2. When `setData()` was called, `pageData` changed → context value changed → all consumers re-rendered
3. Competitor page re-rendered → effect ran again → `setData()` called → infinite loop
4. This caused Radix UI tooltips to repeatedly attach/detach refs, triggering React's infinite loop protection

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Stabilized ScreenContext (`src/context/ScreenContext.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Replaced `useState` with `useRef` for `pageData` storage
- ✅ Made `getData` and `setData` callbacks completely stable (no dependencies)
- ✅ Removed `pageData` from context value entirely
- ✅ Context value now only changes when route/pathname changes, not when data updates

**Key Benefits:**
- Data updates no longer trigger context consumers to re-render
- `setData()` calls are now side-effect-only operations
- Maintains all AI assistance functionality without performance overhead

### 2. Improved Competitor Page Effect (`src/app/(site)/[lang]/(app)/competitors/competitor/page.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Increased debounce delay from 0ms to 100ms for better stability
- ✅ Added `screenContext.setData` to dependencies (now stable, won't cause loops)
- ✅ Changed `competitors.length` to full `competitors` array in dependencies for proper tracking

**Key Benefits:**
- Better debouncing prevents rapid successive updates
- Proper dependencies prevent stale closures
- State change tracking remains accurate

### 3. Optimized TanStackTable (`src/components/application/table/tanstack-table.tsx`)
**Changes:**
- ✅ Wrapped `handleSelectAll` and `handleRowSelect` in `useCallback` for stability
- ✅ Updated columns memoization dependencies to only include necessary values
- ✅ Removed unstable function references from dependencies where possible

**Key Benefits:**
- Column definitions don't recreate unnecessarily
- Row selection handlers are stable across renders
- Better overall table performance

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to `/en/competitors/competitor` page
- [ ] Verify page loads without console errors
- [ ] Verify no "Maximum update depth exceeded" error
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test tab switching (All/Tracking/Paused)
- [ ] Test pagination
- [ ] Test row selection (individual and select-all)
- [ ] Verify tooltips work properly
- [ ] Verify AI copilot can still read competitor data

## Impact
- **Fixed:** Infinite loop causing app crashes
- **Maintained:** All AI assistance features
- **Improved:** Overall performance and stability
- **No Breaking Changes:** All existing functionality preserved
